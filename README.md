# 📱 AwareMe — Digital Well-Being Assistant

**AwareMe** is a personal research and development project designed to help individuals understand and improve their relationship with their smartphones.  
Its goal is to promote **digital awareness**, reduce **dependence on screens**, and support a healthier balance between online and offline life.

## 🎯 Purpose and Vision

Modern technology has transformed how people connect, learn, and work — yet excessive smartphone use can lead to distraction, stress, and even digital addiction.  
**AwareMe** seeks to address this issue by collecting non-intrusive behavioral data from daily smartphone activity and transforming it into **meaningful insights about digital habits**.

The long-term vision is to create an **intelligent digital companion** that helps users:
- Recognize patterns of excessive phone usage  
- Understand the moments or contexts that trigger overuse  
- Receive personalized recommendations to improve focus and digital well-being

## 🧠 Research and Machine Learning Perspective

Beyond awareness, AwareMe also serves as a foundation for **machine learning experimentation**.  
The anonymized and aggregated data collected by the application will be used to:
- Explore behavioral correlations between app usage, screen events, and connectivity  
- Develop predictive models capable of identifying potential signs of digital overuse  
- Experiment with adaptive systems that can suggest healthier usage routines  

These experiments aim to advance the understanding of **digital behavior analytics** and the potential of **AI for human well-being**.

## 🔒 Ethical Commitment and GDPR Compliance

Respect for user privacy is central to AwareMe’s philosophy.  
All data are **anonymized**, linked only to a randomly generated identifier (UUID), and stored securely for research purposes.  
No personal or identifiable information (names, emails, or content) is collected.  

The project strictly follows the principles of the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**:
- Data minimization — only essential behavioral metrics are gathered  
- Transparency — users are informed about what is collected and why  
- Consent — participation and data sharing remain voluntary  
- Security — all information is handled responsibly and exclusively for analysis

## ⚙️ Technology Stack (Brief Overview)

Although AwareMe focuses on human impact rather than pure engineering, a modern and reliable stack was selected to ensure scalability, flexibility, and future research use.

- **Flutter (Dart)** – for building the mobile application that runs smoothly on Android and allows data collection directly from device usage metrics.  
- **FastAPI (Python)** – for managing data reception and storage; chosen for its simplicity, speed, and natural integration with AI and machine learning workflows.  
- **PostgreSQL** – as a robust, open-source relational database for securely storing anonymized behavioral data.  
- **Python ML Environment** – to later train and test models capable of detecting behavioral trends and generating well-being recommendations.

Each component was chosen for its balance between **research efficiency**, **open-source accessibility**, and **data protection reliability**.

## 🌍 Broader Impact

By combining **behavioral science**, **ethical data collection**, and **machine learning**, AwareMe contributes to the growing movement toward **responsible and mindful technology use**.  
Its findings could eventually support digital wellness initiatives, educational programs, and further academic research on attention and self-regulation in the digital age.
